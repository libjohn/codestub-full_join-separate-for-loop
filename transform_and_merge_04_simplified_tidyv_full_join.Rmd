Ryan had a much more efficient approach.  Here I'll implement his logic using tidyverse syntax

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Build data frame (country_df) from the first script. Or, see [README](https://github.com/libjohn/codestub-full_join-separate-for-loop/blob/master/README.md) for a view of sample data that you can recreate yourself.

```{r sidea}
side_a <- country_df %>% 
  filter(side_a == 0)

side_b <- country_df %>% 
  filter(side_a == 1)
  
full_join(side_b, side_a, by = "dispute") %>% 
  select(dispute, country.x, country.y)
```
